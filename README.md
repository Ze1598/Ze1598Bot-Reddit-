# Ze1598Bot-Reddit-
A Bot created with Python 3 to scrape posts from Reddit.

This bot was created so I could learn how to interact with the Reddit API, mainly how to scrape posts from subreddits I'm interested in.

Beyond that, the code used for this bot was the foundation of the Reddit scraping I use on my ongoing project Ze1598Bot[Twitter], a Twitter bot.

Right now I have no plans to update this bot, but in the future I will probably come back to it.
